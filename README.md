# Hey!

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making contributing to open-source more approachable, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and GraphQL. In 2020, I was selected to be an inaugural <a href="https://stars.github.com/">GitHub Star ðŸŒŸ</a> based on my involvement in the tech community.  My interest in the React ecosystem led me to launch <a href="https://www.reactrobins.com/">React Robins</a>, a community for women and non-binary ReactJS developers.
